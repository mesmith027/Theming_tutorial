### Repository for the Youtube Theming Tutorial

Hey! So glad to see you here. This is the code to create the exact app from
Streamlit's Theming tutorial.

### The Structure of the Directory
Here we have a standard looking streamlit app project, with a README.md file, a
streamlit app python file (Theme_app.py) and a directory that holds a pickled
data file (dataframe.pkl). To take the app and create a custom theme, the only new
aspect to this fairly standard looking project is the hidden `.streamlit/`
directory which has the `config.toml` file. It is this file that outlines the
custom theme for this app, which is also the default theme!
